# Seasonal Flowers

A Vintage Story mod.

Very much a WIP and not functional atm.

FLowers will have 4 growth-stages:
1. Grow; leaves only. Mostly starts late winter/early spring until flowering.
2. Flower (or bloom?). Depending on type somewhere in Spring/Summer.
3. Rest; leaves only. Until winter.
4. Hibernation; small, brown.
