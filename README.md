# Seasonal Flowers
Tired of seeing vibrant flowers bloom year-round in Vintage Story, breaking your immersion? Seasonal Flowers changes that! This mod introduces realistic seasonal life cycles to vanilla flowers, making them grow, flower, wither, and hibernate according to the in-game calendar.

Flowers now grow, bloom, wither and hibernate. I tried to follow each type of flowers' real-life cycle. To get some colour in winter I assumed heather to be the winter-variant (Erica).

Changes only occur at night so as not to break immersion when they transition suddenly.

## ABANDONED for now
I am unable to get this to work at present.
